Bracket Matches
----

Tu is tired of every IDE/Editor he has made effort to try. Nothing made him happy so far. To list
 a some, Intellij IDEA - too heavy on his Macbook, VIM - he even don't know how to quit (:sad:), Sublime - don't want to use 
editor which everyone uses. So he decided to write his own IDE. It is definitely tons of work. 
Start a litlte, he is going to write some code that make sure the brackets and braces all match.


Goal:
Ensure that all the brackets and braces are matched correctly, and nested correctly.


Input:

`code`: contains code 

bracket pairs:
```
[], (), {}, <>
```

Output:

true - if code satisfied 
false - if not
