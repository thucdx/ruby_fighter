Manh play GO a lots. He undoubtedly loves this game. He has tried so hard but not got so far. 
Recently,
 he decide to play another boardgame that could reach the top soon. As John Nash suggest in 
 <b>Beautiful Mind</b>, he will try <b>Game of Hex</b> 

The abstract boardgame known as Hex / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though 
complex in practice. Two players place stones on a rhombus with hexagonal fields. The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins. The four sides of the rhombus are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides). Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner
 (or lack thereof). The boards look like this (with spaces added for readability, which won't be in the representation passed to your code):

The boards look like this (with spaces added for readability, which won't be in the representation passed to your code):

```
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X

```
<b>Player O</b> plays from top to bottom, <b>Player X</b> plays from left to right. In the above 
example O 
has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since O didn't connect top and bottom.


Goal: Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon
