Daily meeting
-----

At Nal, we are doing daily meeting everyday to update work progress and difficulty. To do 
that, one usually have to answer three questions:
  - What you did yesterday
  - What you gonna do today
  - Is there any problems, difficulty you are struggling with

The sentence may have template likes this:

```
"I did: <what you did>; and will do: <what you gonna do>; my difficulties: <your problems>."
```
  
For example,

`
"I did: Create a logout button and implement code handling that; and will do: Fix bug in login 
screen that customer reported late evening yesterday; my difficulties: don't know how to 
reproduce that bug as it would not happen on my machine."
`

As a developer, participating daily meeting is a-must, writing a program to do this would make 
our job less boring (yeah!!). So, do it now.

Input
`task_done`:

`will_do`: 

`difficulties`:


Output

A sentence follows the template described earlier
