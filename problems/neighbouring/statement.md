We will call two strings "neighbours" if they contain the same characters (maybe in a different order). You are given two strings of the same length consisting of lowercase english letters. In one move you can remove any letter from one of the two strings. Calculate the minimum number of moves necessary to make these strings "neighbours".

Constraints: length of string1, length of string2 <= 1000

[time limit] 4000ms (py3)
[input] string string1

The first string

[input] string string2

The second string

[output] integer

The minimum numbers of moves
